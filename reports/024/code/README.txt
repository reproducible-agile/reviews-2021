The documents included in this dataset provide information on:
a) driving instructions given to each of the two groups
b) an exemplary questionnaire given to participants translated in English,
each one them accompanied with a txt metadata file named accordingly.
c) The dataset itself, in the form of a zip archive, constitutes the responses of the participants to the questionnaire in tabular form of csv files.
The collected data are categorised in distinct csv files according to the theme/topic/part of the survey they correspond to, e.g., Demographics, Santa Barbara Sense of Direction scale (SBSoD), etc.
Metadata on each csv file and their column headings are also included in a txt file, named accordingly. 
Finally, the R script to run all statistical analyses detailed in the paper is also included.
Raw questionnaires, as collected in situ, have been omitted since they are in Greek, and therefore, ilegible to the vast majority of potential users.
