Drivers spatial abilities in unfamiliar environments

Group 1: Landmarks-based driving instructions - participants: 12 
Group 2: Street-based driving instructions - participants: 13

familiarity (Likert scale 1 to 5; 1 – not at all familiar, 2 – slightly familiar, 3 – somewhat familiar, 4 – moderately familiar, 5 – extremely familiar)

SBSoD_scored.csv:
Q1-Q15: the score at each question of the Santa Barbara Sense of Direction Scale
The recommended scoring procedure has been followed as prososed by Hegarty et al, 2002*, to ensure that all items are coded such that a high number indicates more ability and a low number indicates less ability

MapError.csv:
landmarks omitted	- The number of landmarks along the route, among those referred in the instructions, that were omitted by participants on their sketch maps
road segments - The number of road segments that have been omitted or mistakenly added by participants on their sketch maps	
wrong turns - The number of wrongy indicated direction turns, i.e., right turn instead of left, on sketch maps
total map errors - The sum of the previous three columns
landmarks score - The total number of landmarks along the route that were correctly identified and placed on sketch maps
For the first four a low number indicates more ability (less errors), while for the fifth, the opposite holds

Directions.csv:
EST_DR1	
EST_DR2	
EST_DR3

The estimates, in degrees, made by participants on four directions among three points of the route 

Distances.csv:
ESTIM_D1	
ESTIM_D2	
ESTIM_D3	
ESTIM_D4
The estimates, in meters, made by participants on four distances of the travelled route
