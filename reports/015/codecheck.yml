summary: |
    The paper presents the results of a user experiment to improve GI-metadata using speech. A complete
    reproduction is practically impossible to achieve. This reproducibility report therefore investigated two
    components: First, whether sufficient information is provided to replicate the experiment elsewhere with
    a different group of participants. Second, whether sufficient information is provided to reproduce the
    analysis of the experimental results. The conclusion is positive for both. The original 
    prototype is accessible online at the time of this writing. To reproduce the results, the provided
    input data, R code, and Excel spreadsheet lead to the same results as given in the paper and the 
    prototype for the user experiment could be run locally.
