summary: |
    The provided workflow could be partially reproduced, notably the text detection and string similarity
    calculations could be executed and provide sufficiently similar results. Some manual steps were included which
    could not be reproduced, as well as a final step due to long execution time. The software stack was challenging
    to install but overall well documented.
