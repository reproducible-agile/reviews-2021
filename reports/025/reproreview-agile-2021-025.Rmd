# Reviewed paper

> TODO ADD FULL CITATION

# Summary

The authors provide a well documented workflow analysing a large number of Tweets over a considerable time span.
Because of the data size, the authors provided instructions for a data subset, for which the code could be executed successfully and the created figures match the provided baseline, and also confirm that data can be created and the code is available for the results reported in the paper.

# Reproducibility reviewer notes

Started with the anonymous repo at <https://anonymous.4open.science/r/450b6e01-dbad-4ce4-a249-d53e88b6ff8c/README.md> I went trough the pre-requisite steps as below; in the meantime, communication with the authors happened and the review was continued based on the code repository <https://gitlab.irstea.fr/remy.decoupes/covid19-tweets-mood-tetis> which is archived to <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4742152>.

[I also started applying for an academic Twitter project to handle the large number of requests, but did not follow though.]

```{bash data, eval=FALSE, size="tiny"}
git clone https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs

mkvirtualenv agile-025
pip install --upgrade twarc
twarc configure
# The credentials for nordholmen have been saved to your configuration file at /home/daniel/.twarc

# following https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs#hydrating-using-twarc-cli
pip3 install tqdm

# in ./COVID-19-TweetIDs
python3 hydrate.py
```

This ran for ~ 4 hours, then threw `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object`, but luckily, `hydrate.py` skips existing files, so I just restarted the process.
After several more hours, I reached out to the authors and asked for a smaller reproducible workflow.

---------

**Continue review based on de-anonymised repo [gitlab.irstea.fr/remy.decoupes/covid19-tweets-mood-tetis](https://gitlab.irstea.fr/remy.decoupes/covid19-tweets-mood-tetis).**

```{bash data2, eval=FALSE, size="tiny"}
git clone https://gitlab.irstea.fr/remy.decoupes/covid19-tweets-mood-tetis

pip3 install -r covid19-tweets-mood-tetis/requirements.txt
```

Now, I try to run the "mini reproducible workflow" described in <https://gitlab.irstea.fr/remy.decoupes/covid19-tweets-mood-tetis#run-a-mini-reproducibility-workflow-for-agile2021>.

```{bash hydrate2, eval=FALSE, size="tiny"}
cd covid19-tweets-mood-tetis/
git checkout agile-reproducibility
export PWD=$(pwd)

cd experiments/agile21/echen_input_filtred/tweets/ && python3 hydrate.py
# takes just a few minutes

mkdir hydrating-and-extracting && find . -name '*.jsonl.gz' -exec cp -prv '{}' 'hydrating-and-extracting' ';'

gunzip hydrating-and-extracting/id.jsonl.gz
```

I run the indexing and geocoding in a container as follows.
First I start Elasticsearch, following https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/master/get-started-docker.html and adjusting paths and the host in `logstash-config/{json.conf,twitter_template.json}`.
The local directories are mounted into the `log01` container.

```{bash elasticsearch, eval=FALSE, size="tiny"}
docker-compose up -d

# configure Elasticsearch to not complain about only 40 GB left... https://stackoverflow.com/a/63881121/261210
curl -XPUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:9200/_cluster/settings -d '{ "transient": { "cluster.routing.allocation.disk.threshold_enabled": false } }'
curl -XPUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:9200/_all/_settings -d '{"index.blocks.read_only_allow_delete": null}'

# start a logstash container and connect it to the network with access to the required files

```

I let this run overnight and got `7985` tweets, as shown in the Figure below.

```{r screenshot1, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Screenshot of Kibana after loading Tweets"}
knitr::include_graphics("tweet-count.jpg")
```

The geocoding seems to have worked:

```{r screenshot2, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Screenshot of Kibana: Tweet geolocation on map"}
knitr::include_graphics("tweet-map.jpg")
```

Next, I try to run the _main script_:

```{bash mainscript, eval=FALSE, size="scriptsize"}
python COVID-19-TweetIDS-ES-Analyse.py
```

The scripts seems to run successfully:

```{bash,  eval=FALSE, size="tiny"}

The script also created some output files in `experiments/agile21/results/jan_2weeks_week/`, including some figures (see below), which match the ones mentioned in the README for the reduced workflow with small changes that can be explained due to the non-deterministic creation of the test dataset.

These figures resemble the ones in the paper using the full dataset.
Therefore, I am confident the code and data underlying the analysis of the paper are available (or can be created) with the files shared in the repository.
The authors provide detailed documentation for a pretty complex workflow.

The changes made to the configuration (e.g., to make it work with my container setup) using the `agile-reproducibility` branch of the repository are saved to a diff-file published alongside this document and the code is forked to the [Reproducible AGILE GitLab organisation](https://gitlab.com/reproducible-agile/reviews/covid19-tweets-mood-tetis).

```{bash, echo=FALSE}
cd covid19-tweets-mood-tetis/
git diff --ignore-all-space > ../repro-review.diff

# Comments to the authors

- Good job using anonymous.4open.science in the original submission!
- I don't really like the solution to put the small reproducible workflow into a branch - this means that the example code will digress from the original workflow and will at some point be likely to break; I'd prefer to have a subdirectory, ideally you package the reusable parts of the workflow in a proper Python package
- Maybe the docker-compose configuration shared with this review is useful to you - it would be great if you could come a bit closer to a "one click reproduction" with the help of containers, e.g., the steps that I did for logstash could also be automated with the help of a Dockerfile
- ~~Please add information to the README regarding data sizes and expected runtimes! When I started cloning the Echen repo, I did not expect to download gigabytes of data.~~ authors updated the README
- ~~Please provide clear usage instructions in the README, including a list of table mapping scripts/commands to each figure in the manuscript (How can I recreate Figure x?)~~ authors updated the README
- ~~You can also add repository from GitHub in your own `requirements.txt` file and make installation of twarc easier, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/35998253/261210~~ changed by authors
- A more suitable page for installing twarc would be https://twarc-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- Please provide direct links to installation instructions for the ELK stack - IMO a ready-to-use `docker-compose` configuration would be a good idea, the one I used is published in the reproduction material; also, specify the Elasticsearch version that you used.
- CeCILL-B free software license agreement uncommon, if possible use more generally known and understood licenses (I understand this choice might be out of your control); note that the license actually partly deanonymises you
