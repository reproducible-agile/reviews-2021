summary: |
    The authors provide a well documented workflow analysing a large number of Tweets over a considerable
    time span. Because of the data size, the authors provided instructions for a data subset, for which the
    code could be executed successfully and the created figures match the provided baseline, and also confirm
    that data can be created and the code is available for the results reported in the paper.
