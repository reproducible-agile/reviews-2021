summary: |
    The provided workflow was partially reproduced. Based on the provided test file and instructions, we
    were able to recreate the computing environment and run the segmentation models. Relevant tables from
    the paper could be recreated. The training and validation part of the workflow is irreproducible because
    of proprietary data, therefore no figures could be recreated.
