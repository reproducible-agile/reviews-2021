summary: |
    The code, sample API query, and downloaded data were published in a public GitHub repository with a
    working Binder link. All files containing the code could be executed and all tables presented in the paper
    could be reproduced with only minor changes to the code. However, the code does not create figures
    contained in the paper and an attempt to change the results of the model evaluation by changing its
    numerical assumption was unsuccessful. The authors demonstrate concern for the reproducibility of their
    work and actively improved the reproducibility workflow throughout the reproducibility review process.
